# Error Log - Dialectio Application

## Current Errors and Issues

### 1. Database Schema Issues

#### Missing Sample Data
- **Issue**: The database tables exist but are empty, causing the application to show "No courses available" messages
- **Location**: All learning-related pages (LearningDashboard, CourseOverviewPage, CoursePage, LessonPage)
- **Impact**: Users cannot access any learning content
- **Status**: Critical - blocks core functionality

#### Exercise Content Structure
- **Issue**: The `exercises.content` JSONB field structure is not well-defined
- **Location**: `src/types/learning.ts` and `src/pages/LessonPage.tsx`
- **Details**: 
  - Exercise content structure varies by exercise type
  - Missing validation for required fields
  - Inconsistent handling of different exercise types
- **Status**: High priority

### 2. Authentication and User Profile Issues

#### Profile Creation Race Condition
- **Issue**: Sometimes profile creation fails during user registration
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - `signUp` function
- **Details**: 
  - User is created in auth.users but profile creation in profiles table fails
  - Leaves user in inconsistent state
- **Status**: Medium priority

#### Session Management
- **Issue**: Invalid refresh token handling could be improved
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - `useEffect` for session management
- **Details**: 
  - Error handling for expired tokens works but could be more robust
  - User experience during token refresh could be smoother
- **Status**: Low priority

### 3. Learning System Issues

#### Exercise Submission Logic
- **Issue**: Exercise answer validation is overly simplistic
- **Location**: `src/pages/LessonPage.tsx` - `handleSubmitExercise` function
- **Details**: 
  - Only does basic string comparison for correct answers
  - Doesn't handle case sensitivity, accents, or partial matches
  - No support for multiple correct answers
- **Status**: High priority

#### Progress Tracking
- **Issue**: Lesson completion logic may not update course progress correctly
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useLearning.ts` - `completeLesson` function
- **Details**: 
  - Progress percentage calculation assumes all lessons have equal weight
  - No handling for lessons that might be optional or bonus content
- **Status**: Medium priority

### 4. UI/UX Issues

#### Loading States
- **Issue**: Some loading states are not comprehensive
- **Location**: Multiple pages, especially `LearningDashboard.tsx`
- **Details**: 
  - Loading skeleton sometimes shows even when data is available
  - Race conditions between auth loading and data loading
- **Status**: Low priority

#### Error Boundaries
- **Issue**: No error boundaries implemented
- **Location**: Application-wide
- **Details**: 
  - If any component crashes, entire app becomes unusable
  - No graceful error handling for unexpected errors
- **Status**: Medium priority

#### Responsive Design
- **Issue**: Some components may not be fully responsive
- **Location**: Various components, especially complex forms
- **Details**: 
  - Settings page sidebar navigation on mobile
  - Course overview page layout on small screens
- **Status**: Low priority

### 5. Performance Issues

#### Unnecessary Re-renders
- **Issue**: Some components re-render more than necessary
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useLearning.ts` and related components
- **Details**: 
  - useEffect dependencies could be optimized
  - Some state updates trigger cascading re-renders
- **Status**: Low priority

#### Data Fetching
- **Issue**: No caching or optimization for repeated API calls
- **Location**: All data fetching hooks
- **Details**: 
  - Same data fetched multiple times
  - No offline support or data persistence
- **Status**: Low priority

### 6. Type Safety Issues

#### Incomplete Type Definitions
- **Issue**: Some types are not fully defined or used consistently
- **Location**: `src/types/learning.ts` and component props
- **Details**: 
  - Exercise content types could be more specific per exercise type
  - Some component props use `any` or are not typed
- **Status**: Medium priority

### 7. Security Considerations

#### RLS Policy Coverage
- **Issue**: Need to verify all RLS policies are comprehensive
- **Location**: Database schema
- **Details**: 
  - Ensure all tables have appropriate row-level security
  - Verify policies cover all CRUD operations correctly
- **Status**: High priority

#### Input Validation
- **Issue**: Client-side validation could be more robust
- **Location**: All form components
- **Details**: 
  - Some forms rely only on HTML5 validation
  - Server-side validation should be verified
- **Status**: Medium priority

### 8. Missing Features

#### Audio Support
- **Issue**: Audio exercises are defined but not implemented
- **Location**: `src/pages/LessonPage.tsx`
- **Details**: 
  - Audio playback functionality not implemented
  - No audio file handling or storage
- **Status**: Future enhancement

#### Offline Support
- **Issue**: No offline functionality
- **Location**: Application-wide
- **Details**: 
  - App doesn't work without internet connection
  - No service worker or caching strategy
- **Status**: Future enhancement

## Console Errors (Potential)

### 1. Missing Environment Variables
```
Error: Missing Supabase environment variables
```
- **Solution**: Ensure VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are set

### 2. Database Connection Errors
```
Error: Failed to fetch courses
Error: Error loading lessons
```
- **Solution**: Check database connection and table structure

### 3. Authentication Errors
```
Error: Invalid refresh token
Error: User not found
```
- **Solution**: Implement better session management and error handling

### 4. Type Errors (Development)
```
Property 'content' does not exist on type 'Exercise'
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ExerciseType'
```
- **Solution**: Improve type definitions and usage

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate (Critical)
1. Add sample data to database tables
2. Fix exercise content structure and validation
3. Implement comprehensive error boundaries

### Short-term (High Priority)
1. Improve exercise answer validation logic
2. Enhance security with thorough RLS policy review
3. Add better loading states and error handling

### Medium-term (Medium Priority)
1. Implement audio exercise functionality
2. Add comprehensive input validation
3. Optimize performance and reduce unnecessary re-renders

### Long-term (Low Priority)
1. Add offline support
2. Implement advanced features like streaks and achievements
3. Add comprehensive analytics and user behavior tracking

## Notes
- This log should be updated as issues are resolved
